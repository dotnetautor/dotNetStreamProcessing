gulp like stream processing with .net

## Short description
This is a first idea of a stream processor like gulp, just in .net.  
At first it's only a collection of base classes and extension methods to get an idea of how it's working.

## ToDo's
1. Use Roslyn to read a spFile.cs in a project root directory.
2. Use Roslyn to read plugins in sp-pluginname.cs files or from sp-pluginname.dll assemblies.
